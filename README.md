# Neural Network Implementation for a Logic Gate or MNIST Dataset with Visualization

This project presents an implementation of a neural network for a logic gate or the MNIST dataset using PyTorch, along with visualizations for model behavior.

## Overview
The project consists of the following main components:
1. **Neural Network Implementation**: The code implements a neural network model using PyTorch, specifically tailored for the training and testing of a logic gate or the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
2. **Data Preparation**: It includes the preparation and loading of the dataset, ensuring that the data is transformed and organized to work seamlessly with the neural network model.
3. **Training the Model**: The model is trained using appropriate optimization and loss functions to ensure optimal performance.
4. **Visualizations**: The code integrates visualizations to showcase components like model architecture, training progress, and model predictions.
5. **Gradio Interface (Optional)**: If applicable, the code can utilize Gradio to create an interactive web-based interface for real-time digit classification or logic gate operations.

## Usage
- To use this code, follow the instructions in the main script. Ensure that all necessary libraries and dependencies are installed and updated.
- A separate section in the documentation should specify the steps to run the code to train the model and visualize the results for both logic gate and MNIST dataset use cases.
- If using Gradio for interactive interfaces, include details for launching and interacting with the web-based interface.

## Visualization Details
- Include information about the various visualizations provided by the code, such as model architecture diagrams, training progress charts, and sample model predictions.
- Explain how the visualizations can be accessed and how they aid in understanding the model's behavior, accuracy, and training process.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- PyTorch
- Gradio (if using for interactive interfaces)
- Other libraries as specified in the main script

## Example Usage
1. Run the logic gate neural network or MNIST dataset neural network implementation script to train the model.
2. Utilize the visualization functions to gain insight into the model architecture and training progress.
3. If applicable, interact with the Gradio interface and analyze the model's predictions.
